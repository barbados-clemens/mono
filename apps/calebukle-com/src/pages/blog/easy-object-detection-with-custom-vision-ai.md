title: How To Make  A Custom Image Object Detection Model (The Easy Way)
description: I've been trying to make and train a custom machine learning model for detecting specific objects in images. After some exploring, I found a massively easy way to do this. Here is my found solution to build, train, and output the model in the desired ML Format!

Recently, I started tinkering with machine learning via
[ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet),
Microsofts new library for ML type tasks. It's really nice and I'm super excited
about its future. But with it being so new, it is currently not able to help me
train a model that will detect objects in images. They have a great tutorial
using a pre-trained
[TinyYOLOv2](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/tiny_yolov2)
model. But no custom models. Thus I set up going through ways to make my own.

The most promising method was to use Python to retrain the
[TinyYOLOv2](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/tiny_yolov2)
model with my image set. Only one issue. I don't really know Python. Sure I
could have hacked my way through it, but at the end of the day, I prefer my C#
and .NET world. so I kept looking. Finally, I found the best solution for me.

Let me introduce you to [custom vision](https://customvision.ai), this is a
service run by Microsoft that allows you to... you guessed it, make your own
custom object detection models. Yay! ðŸŽ‰ Exactly what I need and better yet, you
can train, test and utilize your model all within this service. Once you're done
training and validating you can publish your model and use their REST API to
perform predictions, all without having to really worry about anything yourself.
If you don't want to use their API, like me, you can just download your model in
the desired format you wish with C# and Python generated code ready for
consumption. How awesome is that?!

Okay so there is one catch, it costs money. roughly $3 for a quick training
session, $2 per 1000 transaction and $20 an hour to train. But for what you're
getting I'd argue very much worth the cost. Check out their pricing
[here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/)

So let's walk through how to use the service.

1. Go to https://customvision.ai
1. Login with an Azure account
   - if you don't have a Microsoft account then you'll need to make one
     [here](https://portal.azure.com/)
1. Click "New Project"
1. Fill out the Name, Description and resource
   - if you need to make a new resource, just follow the onscreen prompts.
   - you can view these resources inside of the
     [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
1. Select the project type you'd like -For me, it was "Object Detection"
1. Select Desired Classification Types
   - Tag would be object
1. Select Domain, I picked _General (compact)_
1. Wait for everything to be created
1. Start making your datasets!

You're all set to go and it's really that easy.

I recommend doing a quick train once you have 15 photos marked of each
classification or object tag you want to work with. This is a short session that
gives you a really rough idea about your model's performance. Also, it's a good
way to generate code up to start scaffolding your project if other people are
wanting to play around with the model.

![After Training Metrics](https://media.calebukle.com/uploads/custom-ai-metrics.png)

From my limited internet reading, I've seen a recommendation of about 300 photos
per classification you want to detect. which is a lot of photos. More data never
hurts in these cases!

When you're ready you can do a full training session and limit the amount of
training time. This is under _Advance Training_ option

![Training Screen](https://media.calebukle.com/uploads/train-modal.png)

When you're done training either via quick training or advance training you can
export your training model via the "export" button. You'll receive a prompt to
select the type of model and the format. I did General Compact and ONNX as
that's what's preferred for ML.NET. But select what's best for you use cases.

Hopefully this helps out some people who were in the similar situation as me. I
hope to be doing more machine learning content in the future. Have a great day
ðŸ˜ƒ!

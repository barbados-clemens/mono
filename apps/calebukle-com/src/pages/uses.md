## Office Life

Starting with the base, my desk is a
[6' (183cm) workbench from Lowe's](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-Kobalt-72-in-Work-Table/5000045517).
I much prefer these workbenches because they are more stable and cheaper than
desks from office supply companies. Only downside is converting it into a
standing desk doesn't look very straight forward, but that's a problem for a
future me if I so desire to go that route. Since I don't have a standing desk I
sit in the
[EgoChair Pro in blue](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair?option20=56)

For the most part I end up rocking with Apple devices.
[iPhone](https://apple.com/iphone),
[Apple Watch](https://apple.com/apple-watch),
[MacBook Pro M1 Max](https://apple.com/macbook-pro) are my current devices.

I'll keep my laptop docked 90% of the time via a
[CalDigit TS4 Dock](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1689415-REG/caldigit_ts4_us_amz_caldigit_ts4_thunderbolt_station_4.html).
Filling up all my USB ports on the dock are my
keyboardâ€”[Keychron K2 Cherry MX Brown](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)
with
[/dev/tty keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/drop-matt3o-mt3-dev-tty-keycap-set),
micâ€”[Elgato Wave:3](https://www.elgato.com/en/wave-3) with
[Elgato mic arm](https://www.elgato.com/en/wave-mic-arm),
webcamâ€”[Logitech Brio](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/brio-4k-hdr-webcam.html),
and [Steam Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck). I don't use a mouse,
but the
[Magic TrackPad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMMP3AM/A/magic-trackpad-white-multi-touch-surface)
instead. As for what I stare at all day I use the
[GigaByte Aorus FO48U](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO48U#kf), though
be cautious as
[OLED burn-in isn't a joke](https://twitter.com/CU_Galaxy/status/1546861904840245250)
ðŸ˜¬.

### Dev Stuff

I use three different editors for various reasons. My primary editor of choice
is [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). I love it for its powerful
IDE feature like really robust refactoring. I also use
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for mostly using
[Nx Console](https://nx.dev/using-nx/console) and for running multiple projects
side by side, so I know which one is (i.e. webstorm and vscode side by side).
Finally, I like using [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) for basic text
editing or for demos that involve an editor and showing the console, this way I
only have to record on window.

That window being my [terminal app of choice, Warp,](https://www.warp.dev/).

For fonts in all my editors and terminals I currently am using
[MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/). Though I also like,
[Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono),
[Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code), and
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). I also prefer the
[Night Owl Theme by Sarah Drasner](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme)

### Other Useful Apps

Navigating around my computer I like to use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).
[CleanShotX](https://cleanshot.com/) for screenshots/recording my
screen.[Cron](https://cron.com/) and [SparkMail](https://sparkmailapp.com/) for
multi account management of my calendar and email respectively. Finally, I
really like using [Centered](https://www.centered.app/) for focusing my getting
tasks done.

## Hobbies

### Music

I've semi recently starting ~~hoarding~~ collecting Vinyl records. You can see
my
[current collection on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/Barbados_Clemens/collection).
My current set up is a
[Fluance RT82](https://www.fluance.com/rt82w-reference-high-fidelity-vinyl-turntable-natural-walnut)
with an [acrylic slipmat](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H52BXY1). This is
connected to a [Schiit Mani](https://www.schiit.com/products/mani-2) and ran
into an
[Emotiva TA-100](https://emotiva.com/collections/pre-amps/products/basx-ta1-stereo-preamp-dac-tuner-with-integrated-amplifier)
then out to my
[Pioneer SP-BS22-LR](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008NCD2LG) speakers
(looking to upgrade to different speakers some day). While I love vinyl
collecting I do, I initially started collecting/listening to digital music and
have amassed quite a few things since I started.

My current setup my digital source into a
[Schiit Modius DAC](https://www.schiit.com/products/modius), then the balanced
output goes into my
[Topping A90 amp](https://apos.audio/products/topping-a90-headphone-amp). The
unbalanced input goes to my
[Singxer SA-1 amp](https://apos.audio/products/singxer-sa-1-fully-balanced-amplifier).
I also have an [ifi Zen Can](https://ifi-audio.com/products/zen-can/) that is
connected to the pre outs of the A90.

As for headphones, I use mainly my
[HIFIMan Sundara](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077XDWT7X), but also have on hand

- [HarmonicDyne Zeus](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L3MMGY8)
- [Meze 99 Noir](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-meze-99-noir-closed-back-headphones)
- [Sennheiser 6xx](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-sennheiser-hd6xx)
- [Sony wh-1000xm3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4MNFS1)(Mostly used for
  flying)
- [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/)

...and I think a couple other headphones that are in storage somewhere that I
never use anymore.

That is just in my office. In the living room I also listen to music throughout
the day, where I have my big speakers a stereo pair of
[JBL Studio 580](https://www.jbl.com/loudspeakers/STUDIO+580.html?dwvar_STUDIO%20580_color=Black-USA-Current&cgid=loudspeakers)
powered by a
[Yamaha RX-V4A](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/av_receivers_amps/rx-v4a/index.html)
Receiver.

The music is streamed from my NAS via [Roon](https://roonlabs.com) to a
Raspberry Pi running [RoPieee](https://ropieee.org/). I also use Spotify Connect
on the receiver if I don't have the music on my NAS. Speaking of my NAS...

### Networking

On my network I have a
[Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS420+) to store all my
music, movies, various files and documents.

The NAS feeds my home server that runs my [Roon server](https://roonlabs.com),
[Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv) and various other internal services I like
to mess around withâ€”mostly home automation platforms.

The network consists of [Unifi devices](https://ui.com/wi-fi) and I also use
[Unifi Protect](https://ui.com/camera-security) devices for security cameras
around the house

Don't forget to keep your stuff on
[battery backup!](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AX9Z7R4/)

I also like [Kline Tools](https://www.kleintools.com/) for networking tools like
[ethernet testers](https://www.kleintools.com/catalog/cable-length-measurement/cable-tester-kit-scout-pro-3-tester-remotes-adapter-battery)
and
[crimpers](https://www.kleintools.com/catalog/cable-tools/ratcheting-cable-crimper-stripper-cutter-pass-thru)

### Car Detailing

> [Sing it with the feeling now, car wash yeah](https://open.spotify.com/track/1D4seOF29tvkqMDwn9oXrH)

Now washing a car doesn't seem like a hobby, and it isn't really for me, but
it's something I do and have found a handful of products I've found useful and
wanted to list them here. I blame
[Jessica Tran on TikTok](https://linktr.ee/jtmd) for me falling into this rabbit
hole.
